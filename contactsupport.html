                <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p> Smash.gg was started in <b>2015</b> by a small team of amateur players and fans active in the esports community.  Since we started, our goal has been to build active esports scenes around the games people love to play. Today, we support over <b>6,000 active event organizers</b> across a broad mix of games. We provide <b>bracket</b> and <b>registration functionality</b> for both online and live events, running from 16 person LAN events to online tournaments with thousands of participants. Our software is free to use for anyone. We often work with sponsors and game developers looking to connect with their player communities and are always happy to share our insights.</p>
                    <b>Weâ€™d love to talk to you about your next esports project.</b>
